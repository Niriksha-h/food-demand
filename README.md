HIGH DEMAND FOOD PREDICTION USING DATA SCIENCE
This project is mainly focused on helping restaurants make smarter, data-driven decisions. The goal was to analyze menu offerings from various popular restaurants and predict which dishes are likely to become bestsellers.
By collecting and studying both quantitative data (like sales figures and seasonal trends) and qualitative data (such as customer reviews, ratings, and menu descriptions), I was able to uncover key patterns behind a dishâ€™s popularity.
I also implemented machine learning models to forecast future dish performance providing valuable insights that can help restaurant owners optimize their menus, manage inventory more efficiently, and create targeted marketing strategies.
This project has been a great learning experience, combining data analysis, NLP, and predictive modeling aimed at solving a real-world problem in the food industry
